              When selecting a vehicle type, the numbers returned will be those relating to any
              crash where the vehicle is involved. Please note these technical limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                NYPD officers use free form entries to report the vehicle involved in a crash.
                CHEKPEDS maps these entries to eight categories.
              </li>
              <li>
                NYPD captures up to five (5) vehicles included in a crash. As long as one of these
                vehicles matches the filter selected, the related injuries and fatalities will be
                counted â€“ even if the vehicle is potentially not directly responsible for the
                fatalities/injuries.
